      <p class="pRules">My name is Ethan McCracken and I currently live in Glasgow. I'am a Computing Science student at the City Of Glasgow College where I'am
      involved in learning many programming concepts such as Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Object Oriented Analysis Design (OOAD) and many more interesting technologies. I hope to one display
    become a fully fledged Software Developer working on the cutting edge of technology</p>
